# TODO
- [ ] Open user profile in new tab, but doing this is removing the icon from status bar. Same for New Docs as well
- [ ] If I login via role = user on Admin, home page is breaking, bcz the adminDetails API is giving me error (Error - Role User is not allowed to access this resource.) And bcz of this error somehow, reload ho raha hai baar baar
- [ ] Tickets wala entire work
- [ ] All tickets should be sorted by createdAt and the statuses should also be in line, like new -> acknowledged and then closed. Currently the status come randomly
- [ ] Open tickets list page, and then login on anther device (postman), now refresh the ticket login page. It gives error, reload again, now it will redirect to login. It should redirect to Login in the first reload only.
- [ ] Integrate Sentry

- [x] Revamp the home page
